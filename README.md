## Software development to optimize your business

Each business has its own bottlenecks and these will be impacting the performance of your business. Areas such as processing standard emails, tracking enquiries, time tracking, customer invoicing and arrears chasing â€“ all these tasks are vital to your business.

They must be done, but when they take up too much of your time, you and your business can suffer.

Hiring more staff is one solution. However, small time-saving Web Applications can often be more cost effective.

I  work with you to create and implement a process to suit you and your business;

* to make it more efficient and easier to manage
* to find the balance between technical solution and business solution
* to ensure the smooth running of the technical side of your business
* to be there to provide technical solutions to help your business grow
